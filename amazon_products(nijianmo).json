            "Ideal for home brewers or just regular ol' beer drinkers, this cooler keeps cold brews on tap and ready to pour. With a capacity of 6.5 cubic feet, the cooler holds up to a half-barrel keg and comes with a complete CO2 tap system to get things flowing. The tap system includes a Sankey keg tapper, a type that fits all North American beer kegs; a pressure gauge; a pressure regulator; and an arm, for pulling drafts, that rises out of the cooler's top. A cleaning kit and beer FAQ guide are thrown in for good measure. The cooler's sleek black exterior and compact size (37 inches tall, 23-5/8 inches wide, and 25 inches deep) make it inconspicuous in the corner of a rec room, workroom, or kitchen. However, four casters on this kegerator's bottom let hosts move the unit to where the party is. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"

This set of four 9-inch-square burner covers are designed to fit over square-shaped burners on a gas stove. Part of Pfaltzgraff's Flower Garden collection, which encompasses a huge array of dinnerware and decorative household items, these covers bear some of the pattern's signature floral and gardening motifs. Each cover has a white background and a green-and-white checkered border with alternating pictures of potted flowers and leaves featured in the white areas of the border. The covers are made of steel with painted enamel decorations that are dishwasher-safe and resistant to chipping; however, hand washing is still recommended. These burner covers add a whimsical accent to a country-style kitchen on their own and are a fun addition to Flower Garden stoneware and coordinating accessory collections. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"

            "This refill pack of trash bags only fits within Magikan trash disposal systems and are specifically sized to fit the 11-gallon can. This 12-month supply includes three 72-foot-long \"endless\" plastic liners that each last for about 3 to 4 months. The novelty of these liners is that they can be cut into a bag of any size in order to dispose of garbage before it becomes odorous. For example, after disposal of food waste or dirty diapers, that portion of the liner can be immediately cut into a bag and hauled outside for curbside pickup while packaging and other nonperishable garbage can linger a while longer. On average, a household can get about 30 to 40 bags out of each liner. Liners are white and made of a thick, durable plastic that is less likely to break and have a pleasant spring flower scent to cover up any noxious odors. An installation guide shows how to set up the refill bag within the Magikan system. <i>--Cristina Vaamonde</i>"

            "Use this handy controller to regulate the temperature in your freezer between 20 - 80F . Great for turning a chest freezer into a keg refrigerator. Strictly a mechanical thermostat for cooling only, it is simple to use and economical. It operates with a gas filled probe on a 6-foot capillary tube. When the gas contracts or expands in the probe, it triggers a mechanical device inside the control which turns the power on or off. There is no probe temperature readout on the dial, so keeping a thermometer inside the refrigerator is highly recommended to keep track of the actual temperature. On most refrigerators, the controller will allow a usable range of 37 to 80 F, while on freezers, the controller will be able to reach its full 20 to 80 F range. Features: Made of stainless steel. Adjustable with the turn of a knob. No drilling necessary. Plug unit into wall and then run the sensor into your freezer. Male and female plug in one. Specs: Temperature dimensions: 4 3/8\" H x 2 1/8\" W x 1 1/2\" D. Cord dimensions: 6'. Remote sensor bulb: 5 1/2\"W. Remote sensor bulb capillary tube: 6'. Temperature range: 20 - 80F. Voltage: 120 VAC."

The great thing is that without the use of concrete they can be pulled up easily, and there is minimal damage to your lawn, or garden landscape.. . Key Features:. . Stable: anchor point; using fins on the sides of the tube ensures that it will not wobble in the soil.. Cap: prevents the tube filling up with dirt. Its also perfectly suited to allow grass cutting to continue without becoming caught on. Also has a notch to allow storage on the rotory line itself when the dryer is in the tube. Finally the cap has a useful easy lift mechanism.. Ideal Spot: as the soil spear is not intrusive you can have multiple spikes around the garden for different times of year, to make best use of the sun.. Guarantee: of 2 years.."

            "This easy-to-use, compact washer features a durable stainless steel tub and uses a pulsator system rather than a traditional agitator to create a powerful and effective wash action without the twisting and pulling that an agitator can cause. The absence of an agitator also frees up additional space in the wash tub to provide you with maximum wash load capacity. The pulsating action results in superb cleaning performance in a non-abrasive wash environment. It is gentler on clothes as well, making it excellent for items such as cloth diapers, baby clothes, and delicate.",

The electronic controls include a pause button should you need to interrupt the cycle for any reason, and a clear viewing window at the top lets you check on your laundry. LED indicator lights clearly display the cycle status, and an end-of-cycle signal alerts you when clothes are clean and ready to be removed.",

            "The worlds most advanced Moisture and Relative humidity Meter for the flooring industry, the TR210 measures Moisture Content, Relative Humidity, Temperature and Dew Point in concrete and gypsum flooring. The TR210 Moisture/RH meter enables you to carry out 4 individual tests: Measure non-destructively and instantly the moisture content in concrete and gypsum flooring Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point within the floor slab or screed using the (below surface) In-situ method Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point above the surface of the floor slab or screed using RH hood test methods Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point of the environment that the floor is being installed How does it work? In Moisture measuring mode it uses the principle of electrical impedance measurement to give accurate non-destructive moisture readings in concrete and gypsum floor screeds. From Electrodes with special spring mounted probes on the base of the instrument, a low frequency signal is transmitted into the material being tested to measure the electrical impedance. In Hygrometer mode it uses a solid state capacitive sensor RH probe to give accurate and fast relative humidity and temperature readings."

Freeze food to last you on long trips, or set the temperature control to keep fresh food and drinks chilled. All Engel fridge/freezers feature the Engel Swing Motor Compressor.

Engel fridge/freezers run on battery power (12V/24V DC) or 110V/120V AC so whether you're on the road, on the water, or safe at home, you can use your Engel to make life a little easier.",

This set of four 9-inch-square burner covers are designed to fit over square-shaped burners on a gas stove. Part of Pfaltzgraff's Flower Garden collection, which encompasses a huge array of dinnerware and decorative household items, these covers bear some of the pattern's signature floral and gardening motifs. Each cover has a white background and a green-and-white checkered border with alternating pictures of potted flowers and leaves featured in the white areas of the border. The covers are made of steel with painted enamel decorations that are dishwasher-safe and resistant to chipping; however, hand washing is still recommended. These burner covers add a whimsical accent to a country-style kitchen on their own and are a fun addition to Flower Garden stoneware and coordinating accessory collections. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"

            "This refill pack of trash bags only fits within Magikan trash disposal systems and are specifically sized to fit the 11-gallon can. This 12-month supply includes three 72-foot-long \"endless\" plastic liners that each last for about 3 to 4 months. The novelty of these liners is that they can be cut into a bag of any size in order to dispose of garbage before it becomes odorous. For example, after disposal of food waste or dirty diapers, that portion of the liner can be immediately cut into a bag and hauled outside for curbside pickup while packaging and other nonperishable garbage can linger a while longer. On average, a household can get about 30 to 40 bags out of each liner. Liners are white and made of a thick, durable plastic that is less likely to break and have a pleasant spring flower scent to cover up any noxious odors. An installation guide shows how to set up the refill bag within the Magikan system. <i>--Cristina Vaamonde</i>"

            "Use this handy controller to regulate the temperature in your freezer between 20 - 80F . Great for turning a chest freezer into a keg refrigerator. Strictly a mechanical thermostat for cooling only, it is simple to use and economical. It operates with a gas filled probe on a 6-foot capillary tube. When the gas contracts or expands in the probe, it triggers a mechanical device inside the control which turns the power on or off. There is no probe temperature readout on the dial, so keeping a thermometer inside the refrigerator is highly recommended to keep track of the actual temperature. On most refrigerators, the controller will allow a usable range of 37 to 80 F, while on freezers, the controller will be able to reach its full 20 to 80 F range. Features: Made of stainless steel. Adjustable with the turn of a knob. No drilling necessary. Plug unit into wall and then run the sensor into your freezer. Male and female plug in one. Specs: Temperature dimensions: 4 3/8\" H x 2 1/8\" W x 1 1/2\" D. Cord dimensions: 6'. Remote sensor bulb: 5 1/2\"W. Remote sensor bulb capillary tube: 6'. Temperature range: 20 - 80F. Voltage: 120 VAC."

The absence of an agitator also frees up additional space in the wash tub to provide you with maximum wash load capacity.

            "The worlds most advanced Moisture and Relative humidity Meter for the flooring industry, the TR210 measures Moisture Content, Relative Humidity, Temperature and Dew Point in concrete and gypsum flooring. The TR210 Moisture/RH meter enables you to carry out 4 individual tests: Measure non-destructively and instantly the moisture content in concrete and gypsum flooring Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point within the floor slab or screed using the (below surface) In-situ method Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point above the surface of the floor slab or screed using RH hood test methods Measure the relative humidity, temperature and dew point of the environment that the floor is being installed How does it work? In Moisture measuring mode it uses the principle of electrical impedance measurement to give accurate non-destructive moisture readings in concrete and gypsum floor screeds. From Electrodes with special spring mounted probes on the base of the instrument, a low frequency signal is transmitted into the material being tested to measure the electrical impedance. In Hygrometer mode it uses a solid state capacitive sensor RH probe to give accurate and fast relative humidity and temperature readings."

Engel fridge/freezers run on battery power (12V/24V DC) or 110V/120V AC so whether you're on the road, on the water, or safe at home, you can use your Engel to make life a little easier.",

The LintEater, designed for homeowners by a leading manufacturer of professional duct cleaning equipment, makes the regular maintenance of your dryer vent system easy. It effectively removes dangerous lint buildup in almost every type of dryer vent, eliminating a leading cause of house fires. The auger brush and flexible extension rods screw together and spin when powered by your cordless drill (not included). The rotating action of the auger brush and flexible rods scours your entire vent wall surface while traversing the multiple turns that are common in most dryer vent systems. Completely remove all loosened lint from the vent while brushing with the included shop vac or blower adapter. Exceptional reach also makes it a snap to clean behind, underneath and all around your dryer, appliances, baseboard heating vents and other hard-to-reach areas.

            "Enjoy fresh draft beer at home when you use this kit to turn a small fridge into a two-tap kegerator. This kegerator conversion kit has everything you need to dispense two beers at once (as long as your refrigerator can fit two kegs perfectly flat). It features a durable stainless steel tower, a US Sankey (D system) coupler for tapping a majority of domestic kegs, and all the other necessary hardware for pouring perfect pints. The only other piece of equipment you need is a CO2 tank. A tower kegerator conversion kit is a great option for smaller, shorter fridges. Instead of running the faucet and shank through the door of the fridge, just mount the draft beer tower on top and run the beer line directly to the faucet inside the tower. Of course, you can also mount the tower on top of your bar, but be sure not to have too long of a run to the refrigerated keg, as that may cause performance issues due to unchilled lines. Click to download installation instructions Please Note: This kit comes with a US Sankey (D system) coupler. Click here to make sure your keg uses a D system coupler! * Includes - Double tap stainless steel tower, Two-product double gauge regulator kit, (2) Plastic faucet knobs, (2) 5' Air lines with connectors, (2) 5' Beer lines with connectors, and (2) US Sankey keg couplers."

            "Hand-rolled, European craftsmanship brings you the sleek, graceful curves of the Broan Elite RM51000 range hood. This beautiful stainless steel range hood adds a touch of contemporary Europe to blend with today's appliances and kitchen decor -- delivering style and performance. 370 CFM internal blower provides the power you need at 7.0 Sones, using 6-Inch round ductwork for easy installation. Three-speed slide control allows you to set just the right exhaust speed to keep up with whatever is cooking. Dual 20-watt halogen lamps (included) provide bright lighting to the cooktop so you can see what's cooking; one light level on lamps. Dishwasher-safe aluminum filter features a quick-release latch and professional style appearance for good looks and a fresh kitchen. Ducted/non-ducted telescopic flue accommodates ceiling Heights from 8 to 9 feet (included). Extension flues for higher ceilings are also available, (RFX5104) sold separately. Requires separate purchase of a non-ducted kit (RRK51) for indoor exhaust recirculation, which includes one non-duct filter; replacement filters sold separately (FILTERSQUARE). Heat Sentry detects excessive heat and adjusts speed of blower to high automatically to prolong product life. Compatible with optional Broan Make-up Air Dampers (MD6TU or MD8TU, sold separately) to fit 6-Inch or 8-Inch ducting and help to balance the air pressure when the range hood is in use, keeping your environment comfortable."

The manual temperature control makes sure your setting is ideal for your conditions. A drip tray is provided for any spills that may occur. Two leveling legs insure that the unit is level and sturdy in any environment. The stylish rounded door with inset handle is complimented by a white finish.
